# Second Brain

This is second brain :^) It's currently under development and not ready for production. Use it on your own risk!

## Story

I use vim and cli a lot. Wanted to have something that's going to help me to track things and knowledge.
I'm not big fan of Notion so I built my own :^)

## Types of Files and Directories

Pages are simple files that you can use it as a canvas. It's a markdown file.

## Installation
