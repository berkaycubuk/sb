# Second Brain

This is second brain :^) It's currently under development and not ready for production. Use it on your own risk!

It uses [P.A.R.A.](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) method and uses the power of CLI and Markdown.

## Story

I use vim and cli a lot. Wanted to have something that's going to help me to track things and knowledge.
I'm not big fan of Notion so I built my own :^)

## Projects

A project is a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.

## Areas

An area of responsibility is a sphere of activity with a standart to be mainted over time.
